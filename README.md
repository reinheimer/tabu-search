# tabu search for minimal Steiner trees
This is a project about a heuristic called Tabu search, here employed in Steiner trees problem.
Tabu is a powerful technique, once it's stores a few moves around the solutions' neighborhood graph and avoid going back and forth while transposing local minima. 

## Options
-f Input file

-t Tabu tenure

-m Maximum iterations

-c Convergence (iterations without improvement considered sufficient)

-s Create data file for GLPK
